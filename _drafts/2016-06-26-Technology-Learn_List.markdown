The data B+Tree is an clustered index on the user id, and the email B+Tree is a non clustered index on the email. What is the difference between the two? A non clustered index contains as its value the key to find the relevant record. A clustered index contain the actual record data. In other words, after looking up a non clustered index, we need to go to the clustered index to find the actual data, while if we are using a clustered index, we are done with just one lookup.
